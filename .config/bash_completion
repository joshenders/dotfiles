# The profile.d script provides a configuration file hook that can be
# used to prevent loading bash_completion on per user basis when it's
# installed system wide.  To do this, turn off programmable completion
# with "shopt -u progcomp" in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bash_completion
# (~/.config/bash_completion if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set), and turn
# it back on for example in ~/.bashrc if you want to use programmable
# completion for other purposes.

shopt -u progcomp
