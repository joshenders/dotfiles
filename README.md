About
=====

This is my dotfiles repo. If you're looking for secrets about me or one of my
employers, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. I make a concerted
effort to prevent secrets from getting comitted. Nothing here but well
documented configuration directives.

Installation
============

Run `./install.sh` to remove existing files in `$HOME` and create symlinks to
the files in this repository.
